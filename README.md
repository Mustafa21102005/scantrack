# ScanTrack 📚🎓

ScanTrack is a **web-based attendance management system** designed for universities. Students can check in to classes by scanning a **QR code** generated by the lecturer for each lecture. The system automatically tracks attendance, reducing manual effort for lecturers and minimizing fraudulent check-ins.

### ⚠️ Important Note

This project **requires deployment** to work correctly, as QR code scanning needs a publicly accessible URL.

- For local testing, you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 8000
    ```
